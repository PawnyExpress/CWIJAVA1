## Overview
Project 01 is a basic program in which a user inputs a seed for the 
random number generator and a time in integer form. Once the necessary data is 
input the program calculates the distance and cost to 4 random parking spots and determines
which spot is the nearest.

## Compiling and Using
In order to use just run the program and then you'll be prompted for a long and 
integer value in order to generate your parking spots. 

## Discussion
As far as the problem solving for the program, it was pretty straight forward.
I was having a hard time running and testing but that was due to having an older version
of the jdk installed on my machine. There were a few hiccups when using the math classes
as I didn't know I could cast them to an integer in order to be able to take an integer value.
For this project, challenge level was not too high, there were a few things I had to go read
in order to know how to apply them but other than that I feel like it went pretty smooth. 

## Testing
For testing I used the seed's provided in the instructions to make sure my answers matched up.
The street value was changed but x, y, cost and distance matched what they  needed to be based on the seed provided.
