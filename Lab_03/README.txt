## Overview
The following programs are meant to show our ability to use mathematical calculations in java.

## Compiling and Using
The following code can simply be ran, once started the program will prompt the user for necessary inputs to output an answer.

## Discussion
I ran in to an issue at one point where I was trying to use integers with the exponential utility in java.
I soon came to learn that it only accepts a double so I had to assign my integers as doubles through assignment.
I followed that by casting it back to an integer once I had done my calculation and was ready to output it to the terminal.


## Testing
The testing  of projects was done by calculating set values manually on paper and making sure I acquired the same answer in my code.
